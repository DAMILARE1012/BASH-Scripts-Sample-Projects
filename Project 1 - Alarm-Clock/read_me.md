# Project Title: Bash Alarm Clock Script
# Project Description:
This project is a simple, customizable alarm clock implemented as a Bash script. It allows users to set a timer for a specified duration (such as "8h" for 8 hours or "20m" for 20 minutes), after which a sequence of alarm sounds will play to wake the user up. The script uses ASCII art to display wake-up messages and logs all alarm events (start, each sound played, and finish) to a log file for record-keeping.
# Key Features:
1. Set a Sleep Timer:
    - Users can specify how long they want to sleep using flexible time formats (seconds, minutes, hours, days, or combinations).
2. Custom or Default Alarm Sounds:
    - Users can use the default set of alarm sounds or specify their own audio files to be played as alarms.
3. Visual Wake-Up Messages:
    - The script uses figlet to display large, eye-catching ASCII art messages when the alarm goes off.
4. Event Logging:
    - All alarm events are logged with timestamps in a log file for future reference.
5. Input Validation:
    - The script checks for valid time formats and ensures all required alarm sound files exist before starting.
6. Cross-Platform (with Bash):
    - Works on any system with Bash, mpv, and figlet installed (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL or Git Bash).
