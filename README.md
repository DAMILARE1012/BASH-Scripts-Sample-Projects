* Project 1 - [Alarm-Clock](https://github.com/DAMILARE1012/BASH-Scripts-Sample-Projects/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Alarm-Clock)
  - This project is a simple, customizable alarm clock implemented as a Bash script. It allows users to set a timer for a specified duration (such as "8h" for 8 hours or "20m" for 20 minutes), after which a sequence of alarm sounds will play to wake the user up. The script uses ASCII art to display wake-up messages and logs all alarm events (start, each sound played, and finish) to a log file for record-keeping.
